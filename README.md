# Movie-Recommendation-System
A recommendation engine with the help of Python, from basic models to content-based and collaborative filtering recommender systems.

### I have built three types of recommendation systems
#### Simple Recommenders:
offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. An example could be IMDB Top 250.

#### Content Based recommenders:
suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person likes a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. And to recommend that, it will make use of the user's past item metadata. A good example could be YouTube, where based on your history, it suggests you new videos that you could potentially watch.

#### Collaborative filtering engines:
These systems are widely used, and they try to predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item-based on past ratings and preferences of other users. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.
